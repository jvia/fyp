    Description:

        This experiment automates the creation of a model from an observation,
        running this model against a running CAST system, and saving the results
        for further use.

        There are five settings you need to be aware of:
            1. name
                The name of the experiment. It use this to name all of the files
                saved during the experiment.
            2. wd
                Sets the working directory. Essentially, where should the experiment
                should look for the files you specify.
            3. observation
                The observation file to look for. This should be a filename but without
                the .obs
            4. model
                The model file to look for. This should be a filename but without the .ml
            5. size
                The number of observations to collect while running the fault detector.
