\chapter{Motivation}
\label{cha:motivation}

\begin{itemize}
\item What is the problem?
\item Who else has wanted to solve it and how did they do it?
  (High-level, the details will be in the literature review)
\item What was my my base goal for the project?
\item Introduce the rest of the dissertation
\item intro literature review
\item intro background
\item intro mention reducing the model
\item intro project management
\item intro project evaluation
\end{itemize}

Something \cite{Antonelo2008}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Literature review
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Literature Review}
\label{cha:lit-review}

\begin{itemize}
\item Talk about the approaches used by others in more depth than what
  was hinted at in the motivation. Keep it concise and at a
  high-level.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Background
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Background}
\label{cha:background}

% Example system:
%     a      b      c
%  A ---> B ---> C --->


The trained model:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
  P_{aa} & P_{ab} & P_{ac}\\
  P_{ba} & P_{bb} & P_{bc}\\
  P_{ca} & P_{cb} & P_{cc}
\end{bmatrix}
\]

\begin{itemize}
\item Give the necessary background to understand Raphael's approach.
\item Explain the math concisely.
\item Give detailed explanation of the learned model so later
  asymptotic analysis fits the story.
\item Include a 2 component system which will serve as the example
  throughout the paper.
\item Use the example system to create an example matrix in all its
  glory
\item Mention CAST and give a brief overview of how it works, perhaps
  juxtaposing it to XCF (although this may be out of the dissertation
  scope).
\end{itemize}

% Train a model for each tuple $(e_i,e_j)$ in the Cartesian product of
% the unique set of observations $U_E$.

% The model of the system then becomes $M = \{P_{ij}|(e_i,e_j) \in U_E
% \times U_E$

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Original system
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Original Implementation}
\label{cha:orig-impl}

\begin{itemize}
\item Original system: the idea (just mention because it should be
  explained in the background), the implementation, and the
  experimental results.
\item Refer back to the original idea explain in the background
\item Talk about implementation (FTS, CAST component, modifying aucom, etc.)
\item Experimental setups
\item Experimental results
\item Asymptotic analysis as motivation for my extension.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Reduced system
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Connection-based Model}
\label{cha:conn-based-model}

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
  P_{aa} & \empty & \empty\\
  P_{ba} & P_{bb} & \empty\\
  \empty & P_{cb} & P_{cc}
\end{bmatrix}
\]


\begin{itemize}
\item First attempt, using a connection-based model
\item the connection-based idea
\item refer to jen's work
\item implementation
\item asymptotic analysis of the model
\item reminder about experimental setups
\item experimental results
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Metronome system
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Metronome Model}
\label{cha:metronome-model}

% Metronome model
%
%    a      b      c
% A ---> B ---> C --->
%
%       M
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
  P_{am} & P_{bm} & P_{cm} & P_{mm}
\end{bmatrix}
\]

\begin{itemize}
\item Metronome-based approach:
\item the idea (showing a simple worked
  example)
\item the implementation
\item asymptotic analysis.
\item remind experiment setup
\item Show experimental results showing that this approach is just as
  performant as the original system.
\item Maybe worth showing the ROC analysis of the three systems to show
  how they perform under a range of parameter values.
\end{itemize}

%% Management
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Project Management}
\label{cha:project-management}
Large projects are strenuous. Effective project management then
becomes crucial in ensuring constant progress throughout all periods
of the academic year. 

Git was used rather than Subversion for one key reason: it is easy to
maintain multiple branches of the code and move changes to all of
them. This feature was especially important because it meant that
multiple ideas about the model implementation could be kept in
separate branches. In Subversion, doing the equivalent would have made
it very difficult to make updates to all branches when bugs were found
and fixed.

Because inheriting such a large code-base can be overwhelming, unit
tests were used to create a contract of behavior for the most critical
classes in the system. And by using Jenkins as a continuous
integration server, it was possible to know when any change to the
code caused a test on any branch to fail. Jenkins also published the
results of static analysis run by Maven, the build system used. Static
analysis helped suss out potential bugs and resulted in more robust code.

Perhaps the most important aspect of project management, and
unfortunately discovered only towards the end of the project, was
issue management. It was possible to set project milestones and attach
the issues necessary to complete the milestone. This has the benefit
of putting in concrete terms the steps necessary to reach a goal. So
rather than flailing around to figure out what to do next, there was
always a concrete task that could be done.

%% Project evaluation
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Project Evaluation}
\label{cha:project-evaluation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Honest project evaluation:
\item Talk about what I did right 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item summer work in anticipation of a busy first term
  \end{itemize}
\item the things from which I can learn.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item sticking with something even when it doesn't work
    \item setting better goals
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Conclusion
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Future Work}
\label{cha:future-work}

\begin{itemize}
\item Tie the story together \& mention some ideas for future
  work.
