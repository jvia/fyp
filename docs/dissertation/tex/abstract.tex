% The Abstract should be a succinct and self-standing summary of the
% basis and achievements of the project. Be straightforward and
% factual and avoid vague statements, confusing details and "hype". Do
% not be tempted to use acronyms or jargon to keep within the
% half-page limit. Consider that search engines, librarians and
% non-computer scientists wishing to classify your dissertation rely
% on the abstract. You may if you wish provide a short list of
% keywords (2-6 is reasonable) at the end of the abstract.
