\begin{abstract}
  Fault-detection in robotics systems is a difficult task and as
  robotics systems are becoming more complex, subtle errors are
  becoming harder to diagnose. Traditional fault-detection approaches
  have relied on explicit modeling of component behavior, but this
  technique does not scale to complex robots operating in dynamic
  environments. In this project, a new technique which involves making
  the robot self-aware to the internal state of its components is
  examined. The aim of this project is to implement and determine
  the efficacy of a probabilistic self-awareness model for the
  robotics middleware CAST, and if time allows, deal with shortcomings
  of the original approach.
